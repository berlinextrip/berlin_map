            <p> <center>   <font size="+1">Hey Legend, I made this map of Berlin for you in case your phone breaks again or something haha. I indicated a few places that Ive been told are cool, but this is just a start. There is a lot of exploring to do!</font>  <center><p>	
				<center><div id="ljka" style="width: 1700px; height: 500px"></div><center>

					<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet-hash/0.2.1/leaflet-hash.js"></script>
			<p><center> <font size="+1">My idea was that you can add the coolest places you can find to the map, so I go one day and maybe visit them, since i cant come this time. All in all, have a lot of fun, explore, get lost, meet cool people and take a lot of photos. Also,  share the playlist that you will make in berlin with meeee! <font><center></p>
